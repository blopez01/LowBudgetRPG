A small 3rd person rpg (June 2020)
Low Budget RPG by Ben Lopez
===========================
How to Play:
- Open LowBudgetRPG.exe
- WASD to move 
- Mouse to look around
- Space to jump/double jump
- E to equip a weapon
- F to draw your weapon
- When unsheathed:
	- Left click to swing
	- Clicking fast results in up to a 3-hit combo
	- WASD + Space to roll in desired direction
- Left shift to target camera to closest enemy

About the Game:
Low Budget RPG is, you guessed it, a RPG made in Unreal that has $0 in funding! How exciting! Jokes aside, this is my first project using Unreal Engine instead of Unity, and is my current side-project that I've decided to tackle amongst the stay at home orders this summer (2020). After finishing my playthrough of Final Fantasy 7 Remake, (which was absolutely fantastic and if you haven't played it you need to right now) I decided I should try my hand at recreating the combat system from the game for a sweet Unreal project.

Future Additions:
This little demo needs a lot more work before I can say it's complete, but some future additions include:
- Dashing to targeted enemies. This should be implemented as soon as I make or find an animation for it
- Enemy Health and AI, so they're not just sitting ducks and can defend themselves :)
- ATB charge building when doing basic attacks
- Spell/Ability casting system during combat
	- Slow down time and choose from a list to cast either a spell or an ability
	- Spend MP and ATB charges to cast a spell or ability
- Environment building, right now the demo area seems a little plain :/
